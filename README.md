This project solves a chess board given a starting configuration specified in 
Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN). The program operates by testing and validating moves 
in the format (source square, destination square), with ranges A-H and 1-8, 
respectively. It keeps track of the state of the game and presents a message 
to the user explaining the end state of the game when the game is over.

This project was completed as part of the MSc Computing at Imperial College London.
